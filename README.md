# MERN Stack

In this Project, I created a simple To-do app using Javascript and deployed it to a MERN webstack. The frontend was done with ReactJS, the backend with ExpressJS, the database was set up using MongoDB (unstructured database) and Node.js was used to run everything on a machine instead of a browser.
